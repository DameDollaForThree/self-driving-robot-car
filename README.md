**Goal**: The robot car is able to 
- "**sweep enemies**" with its arms when it senses a car within 10cm in front it.
- **accelerate** when another car hits the bump at the back of it.
- **make a turn** after sweeping other cars

**Main Components**: an Arduino microcontroller, two micro-servos, robot car's parts, a bump switch, an analog distance sensor
